        <p><br>Not only to achieve a certain professional career position, but also to become the person I am proud of, to find happiness, fulfillment and value in my life. I am willing to focus on and keep the hard work and do whatever it takes of actions that would affect important relationships in my life, because it is my mission to live a life of honestly integrity and unconditional love, to never lose sight of what is most important.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>One of the best ways to gain valuable wisdom is being mentored by the elderly residents, but we also we likely have our own knowledge that can benefit others in our community, the perfect opportunity will show up for sure by considering the areas where we excel and exploring how it can benefit the community.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>One of the recent ventures I've created, Tunisia Indriver Recruiter that aims to recruit taxi drivers and to facilitate their jobs, be their own bosses and boost their income, (you can talk more about it T^T), I see that it is worth putting money into this business, and its success would make me happy as well.

        <h1>and here we go to my " Big Hairy Audacious Goals "</h1>
        <p>Since I was a kid I knew exactly what I've been passionate about and I've spent most of my time doing it, my friends certainly had a reason why they called me "The Computer Guy", me and my computer were known as best friends forever, and across the time I found myself fond of computer networking, that's why I see the best of myself in networking and secuirty things hhhhhhhhhhh "Noob", where I can lead, recognize and develop my strengths as an articulate, hard-working, and insightful person, envision myself becoming a person my family and friends see as a good son, a good Friend, a good human, steadfast, loving, patient, caring, supportive and available.
Further more, revere admirable characteristics in others, such as honor, compassion, tolerance, and patient.</p>
